Usage:       btw(..., clipboard = interactive())       Arguments:       ...: Objects to describe from your R environment. You can pass           objects themselves, like data frames or functions, or the           function also accepts output from get_*() functions like           'get_package_help()', 'get_help_page()', etc. If omitted,           this function will just describe the elements in your global           R environment.  clipboard: Whether to write the results to the clipboard. A single           logical value; will default to 'TRUE' when run interactively.  Value:       The combined elements as a string, invisibly. If 'clipboard' is      'TRUE', the result is also written to the system clipboard.
