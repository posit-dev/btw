\title{Create or edit a btw.md context file}
\usage{
use_btw_md(scope = "project")

edit_btw_md(scope = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scope}{The scope of the context file. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"project"} (default): Creates/opens \code{btw.md} (by default) or \code{AGENTS.md}
in the project root
\item \code{"user"}: Creates/opens \code{btw.md} in your home directory
\item A directory path: Creates/opens \code{btw.md} in that directory
\item A file path: Creates/opens that specific file
}

For \code{edit_btw_md()}, \code{scope = NULL} (default) will find and open the
context file that \code{\link[=btw_client]{btw_client()}} would use, searching first for \code{btw.md}
and then \code{AGENTS.md} in the project directory and then for \code{btw.md} in your
home directory.}
}
\value{
\code{use_btw_md()} returns the path to the context file, invisibly.
\code{edit_btw_md()} is called for its side effect of opening the file.
}
\description{
Create or edit a \code{btw.md} or \code{AGENTS.md} context file for your project or
user-level configuration. These functions help you set up the context files
that \code{\link[=btw_client]{btw_client()}} and \code{\link[=btw_app]{btw_app()}} use to configure chat clients.

\code{use_btw_md()} creates a new context file with a default template. If the
file already exists, it will not overwrite it, but will still ensure the file
is added to \code{.Rbuildignore} if you're in an R package.

\code{edit_btw_md()} opens an existing context file for editing. Without
arguments, it opens the same file that \code{\link[=btw_client]{btw_client()}} would use by default.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{use_btw_md()}: Create a new \code{btw.md} or \code{AGENTS.md} context file in
the current directory, the project directory or your home directory.

\item \code{edit_btw_md()}: Open an existing \code{btw.md} or \code{AGENTS.md} context file
for editing.

}}
\section{Context File Format}{


Files named \code{btw.md} include YAML front matter for configuring the default
chat client and tools. Files named \code{AGENTS.md} follow the
\href{https://agents.md/}{AGENTS.md} convention and do not include YAML
front matter by default (although you are welcome to add it if you want to).

See \code{\link[=btw_client]{btw_client()}} for more information about the format and available
options. See \code{\link[=btw_tools]{btw_tools()}} for a list of available tools.
}

\section{Interactive Setup}{


For an interactive guided setup, consider using \code{btw_task_btw_init()} to use
an LLM to help you create a \code{btw.md} file for your project.
